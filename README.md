#WishBringers

We, a team of 5, worked on the problem statement of "Family Giving Tree" non-profit organization.
The prior problem statement was : THe donors were not able to see how many wishes they had fulfilled in the cart. The webiste performance was poor and the time to view the wishes was pretty high. The search function and the ease of navigation was missing. There was no way the organization could upload the wishlist data(in thousands of numbers) directly via a user interface. 

Our solution:
Our team -- THe Wellwishers decided to solve the above stated problems by making the maximum use of open source technologies like Node JS, Elastic Search, Angular JS and the Bootstrap. 
Now, the donors can register for the organization with the help of user interface. Morover, it is now easy for the Family tree organization to uplioad the wishlist via a simple form . We have made use of the elasric search to make sure that donors can sort, filter and view thousands of wishes on the fly without any lag. Our relational MySQL database keeps tracks of imporatnt information like the donors,payments,cart details,etc.
